"""Regression test for the stamper loop's ValueError handling.

Upstream 779e42c (2019-09-12) added `except ValueError as err:` to __loop but
logged `% exp` in the else-branch -- a name bound only by the sibling
`except Exception as exp:` handler (and, misleadingly, by an earlier
`except FileNotFoundError as exp:` whose binding PEP 3110 auto-deletes at
block exit). Any non-cookie ValueError from __do_bitcoin() -- e.g.
binascii.Error from lx() on a malformed RPC result -- therefore raised
UnboundLocalError inside the handler, escaped __loop, and killed the
anchoring thread while the HTTP server kept accepting digests.

On the pre-fix code this test fails twice over: the thread dies (is_alive
False) and nothing reaches logging.error (assertLogs sees no ERROR record --
the UnboundLocalError goes to the threading excepthook, not the log).
